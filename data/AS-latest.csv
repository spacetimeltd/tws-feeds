The rubber grips are used on picks, probes, scalpels, modeling type knives and small hobby tools. Also use the EzGrip grip whenever repetitive motions are required to gain more precise control over the instrument used, and when small implements must be used over long periods of time. The Pen Grips feature an ergonomic design that is aimed at reducing grip pressure for people suffering from arthritis and carpal tunnel. This pen grip allows the use of one fingertip instead of three fingers. The unique design of this grip allows one finger to exert downward pressure for writing and no squeezing is necessary. The pen/pencil with the applied grip is held lightly without falling out or through the fingers.  <br><br> The Pen Grip greatly reduces grip forces needed to write. Can be used on a pencil, pen, scalpel or any other pencil-like instrument. EZGrips are patented and have been awarded U.S. Utility and Design patents.  <br><br> EZGrip Pen Grips are especially helpful to persons with arthritis, cramping/dystonia, Carpal Tunnel and any type of grip impairment or for just plain comfort. They are used for finger stress relief as well as prevention of cramping, or other difficulties.<!-- product-specs.html begins -->	<P><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2"">		<h4>EZGrip Pen Grips Specifications:</h4>	</FONT>	</P>	<TABLE CELLSPACING=""2"" CELLPADDING=""2"" BORDER=""0"">		<TR VALIGN=""TOP"">		<TD><IMG WIDTH=""24"" SRC=""/assets/images/spacer.gif"" HEIGHT=""12"" BORDER=""0""></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2""><B>Material:</B></FONT></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2"">hypoallergenic rubber compound, latex free.</FONT></TD>	</TR>		<TR VALIGN=""TOP"">		<TD><IMG WIDTH=""24"" SRC=""/assets/images/spacer.gif"" HEIGHT=""12"" BORDER=""0""></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2""><B>Measurements:</B></FONT></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2"">1 1/8 inch in length and 6/8 inch at widest point.</FONT></TD>	</TR>		<TR VALIGN=""TOP"">		<TD><IMG WIDTH=""24"" SRC=""/assets/images/spacer.gif"" HEIGHT=""12"" BORDER=""0""></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2""><B>Includes:</B></FONT></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2"">package of 3 (one of each: red, white, blue) </FONT></TD>	</TR>		</TABLE>	<P><!-- product-specs.html ends -->","ezgrip pen grips, pen grips, writing aid, pen and tool grip, add a grip, pencil grippers, arthritis writing aids, for people with, rheumatoid, osteoarthritis, elderly, seniors, handicap, disability, arthritis, arthritic, therapy, utensils, tools, devices, aids, products","0","/assets/images/ezgrip-1.jpg","/assets/images/ezgrip-1.jpg","/assets/images/ezgrip-5.jpg","/assets/images/ezgrip-4.jpg","","","CMH3904,AMCPKTCK","","0","","","","","EZGrip Pen Grips :: easy to grip & promotes pain free writing","<META name=""keywords"" CONTENT=""ezgrip pen grips, pen grips, writing aid, pen and tool grip, add a grip, pencil grippers, arthritis writing aids, for people with, rheumatoid, osteoarthritis, elderly, seniors, handicap, disability, arthritis, arthritic, therapy, utensils, tools, devices, aids, products""><META name=""description"" CONTENT="" "">","","","0","0","","0","","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","Chris","2/26/2012","","","","","","","","","","","0","","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","-1","0","0","-1","","","0","","0","0","","","","0","0","0","0","0","0","ezgrip-pen-grips.html","0"

Using the ergonomic EzGrip® ResQ Gel Pen is a unique experience -- not only for its writing abilities – described as “…floating on paper,” but having the distinction as a pen that cradles and conforms to your extended finger and tip. Only the slightest touch of that one first finger tip is needed to provide downward writing pressure. Like touching a computer key – but lighter. The other fingers can just ""go along for the ride."" It’s not the usual everyday writing experience, but one more comfortable and advanced. <br><br> The gel ink is closest to fountain pen ink or roller ball in it's writing characteristics. It flows smoothly, and dries quickly. <br><br> By using the EzGrip ResQ Gel Pen, it’s possible to never again get writer’s cramp – never again contemplate the onset of any ""Itis"" – Tendonitis, Arthritis… or repetitive Stress Injuries (RSI’s) such as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. In practical terms it also means that even having those conditions will not matter. Their mechanisms or weaknesses will not enter into the writing process. The EzGrip pen is often called the ""miracle pen"" for persons with arthritis, tendonitis, other hand problems or cramping. It neutralizes hand difficulties immediately. <br><br> Here’s How: Using the EzGrip ergonomic pen as described, the built-in mechanisms within our hands and arms that create those weaknesses are actually disconnected or bypassed. <br><br> The patented EzGrip enables the individual to switch positions, relying on other fingers. Many of us write in personal ways – with different finger holds. The EzGrip allows users to switch fingers at any time to adapt to their individual style of writing. More specifically, the side of the thumb can be used for downward writing pressure – even the middle finger knuckle. There is no incorrect way to hold and use an EzGrip. It’s your choice. And it's a choice that can save you pain and discomfort. <br><br> <b>Uses Parker style refills.</b><!-- product-specs.html begins -->	<P><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2"">		<h4>EzGrip ResQ Gel Ergonomic Pen Specifications:</h4>	</FONT>	</P>	<TABLE CELLSPACING=""2"" CELLPADDING=""2"" BORDER=""0"">		<TR VALIGN=""TOP"">		<TD><IMG WIDTH=""24"" SRC=""/assets/images/spacer.gif"" HEIGHT=""12"" BORDER=""0""></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2""><B>Color:</B></FONT></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2"">Silver w/Navy Grip, soft rubber.</FONT></TD>	</TR>		<TR VALIGN=""TOP"">		<TD><IMG WIDTH=""24"" SRC=""/assets/images/spacer.gif"" HEIGHT=""12"" BORDER=""0""></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2""><B>Ink:</B></FONT></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2"">Black.</FONT></TD>	</TR>		<TR VALIGN=""TOP"">		<TD><IMG WIDTH=""24"" SRC=""/assets/images/spacer.gif"" HEIGHT=""12"" BORDER=""0""></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2""><B>Refills:</B></FONT></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2"">Uses Parker style.</FONT></TD>	</TR>		</TABLE>	<P><!-- product-specs.html ends -->","ezgrip gel pen, resq pen, ez grip pen, ezgrip resq ergonomic pen, for people with, rheumatoid, osteoarthritis, elderly, seniors, handicap, disability, arthritis, arthritic, therapy, utensils, tools, devices, aids, products","0","/assets/images/ResQPenHndFgr341w.gif","/assets/images/ResQPenHndFgr341w.gif","/assets/images/EzGri-_ResQ-Gel-Pen.gif","","","","AIT100,AIT300","","0","","","","","EzGrip ResQ Gel Ergonomic Pen :: helps reduce writers cramp","<META name=""keywords"" CONTENT=""ezgrip gel pen, resq pen, ez grip pen, ezgrip resq ergonomic pen, for people with, rheumatoid, osteoarthritis, elderly, seniors, handicap, disability, arthritis, arthritic, therapy, utensils, tools, devices, aids, products""><META name=""description"" CONTENT=""The EzGrip ResQ Gel Ergonomic Pen is often called the miracle pen for persons with arthritis, tendonitis, other hand problems or cramping.

Use for cold therapy to reduce swelling, or moist heat therapy to stimulate blood flow.","The <b>Elasto-Gel Sinus Mask</b> is a gel therapy mask designed for relief of sinus headaches, sinus infections or post eye surgery. This microwavable hot or cold therapy mask is great for those suffering with sinus headaches. It may be used as a sleep aid to reduce excessive light for daytime sleeping. Place the gel mask in the freezer or refrigerator to be used for cold therapy for reducing swelling, numbing an area, or for pain relief. Warm the mask in the microwave, to use the gel mask for moist heat therapy. The warm, relaxing gel mask can help to stimulate blood circulation and relieve pain. The outside cover can be removed for washing. Universally sized (one size sinus mask fits most).<br><br> Elasto-Gel products from SouthWest Technologies are microwaveable hot/cold therapy products. More than 40 different sizes and shapes have been developed to literally apply hot or cold therapy to any part of the body. These products remain flexible even at temperatures of -20 degrees Farenheit. The product can be stored in the freezer to always have a flexible cold pack and yet be put directly into the microwave and heated to have a flexible instant hot pack (within 5 to 10 minutes). These gel packs stay hot or cold for 20-40 minutes. Many consumers have reported these products have durability of more than 10 years with hundreds of uses per year. Elasto-Gel products do not dry out, do not require rejuvenation by soaking in water, and will not leak if punctured. Do not allow the item to get wet. The gel will absorb water and swell.

Usually the cold wrap will numb the treated area within 5 minutes without the harsh shock and pain that is sometimes experienced with ice or ice water treatments.<!-- product-specs.html begins -->	<P><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2"">		<h4>Elasto-Gel Cervical Collar Specifications:</h4>	</FONT>	</P>	<TABLE CELLSPACING=""2"" CELLPADDING=""2"" BORDER=""0"">		<TR VALIGN=""TOP"">		<TD><IMG WIDTH=""24"" SRC=""/assets/images/spacer.gif"" HEIGHT=""12"" BORDER=""0""></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2""><B>Measurements:</B></FONT></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2"">20 inches long, 10 inches wide center, 4 inches at front closure.</FONT></TD>	</TR>		<TR VALIGN=""TOP"">		<TD><IMG WIDTH=""24"" SRC=""/assets/images/spacer.gif"" HEIGHT=""12"" BORDER=""0""></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2""><B>Straps with Velcro front closure: </B></FONT></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2"">2 x 6 inches.</FONT></TD>	</TR>		<TR VALIGN=""TOP"">		<TD><IMG WIDTH=""24"" SRC=""/assets/images/spacer.gif"" HEIGHT=""12"" BORDER=""0""></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2""><B>Construction:</B></FONT></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2"">Indestructible gel, cover and strap are all latex-free.</FONT></TD>	</TR>		</TABLE>	<P><!-- product-specs.html ends -->","neck therapy, cervical collar wrap, heat therapy for neck, cold therapy for neck, microwaveable therapy packs, gel wraps, elastogel, elasto-gel, warm wrap for neck pain, flexible gel pack, moist heat treatment, for people with, rheumatoid, osteoarthritis, elderly, seniors, handicap, disability, arthritis, arthritic, therapy, utensils, tools, devices, aids, products","0","assets/images/elastogel-cervical-2_thumbnail.jpg","assets/images/elastogel-cervical-2.jpg","/assets/images/Elastogel-cervical-2.jpg","","","","AAM200,AEZ","","0","Elasto Gel Cervical Collar","","","","Elasto-Gel Cervical Collar","<META name=""keywords"" CONTENT=""neck therapy, cervical collar wrap, heat therapy for neck, cold therapy for neck, microwaveable therapy packs, gel wraps, elastogel, elasto-gel, warm wrap for neck pain, flexible gel pack, moist heat treatment, for people with, rheumatoid, osteoarthritis, elderly, seniors, handicap, disability, arthritis, arthritic, therapy, utensils, tools, devices, aids, products""><META name=""description"" CONTENT=""The Elasto-Gel Cervical Collar wrap is made to mold to the cervical neck region to provide pain relief using hot or cold therapy."">","","","0","0","","0","","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","Amy","2/26/2012","","","","","","","","","","","0","","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","-1","0","0","-1","","","0","","0","0","","","","0","0","0","0","0","0","elasto-gel-cervical-collar.html","0"

Thermoskin® supports are made from elasticized fabrics specifically designed to provide even compression and firm support for muscle injury and soreness, with the greatest possible comfort and fit. Thermoskin® stabilizes the hand and wrist and combines compression with naturally generated body heat for therapeutic relief from soreness and discomfort. <br><br> Unique to Thermoskin® elastic supports is Trioxon® - a unique soft material which not only captures and retains your natural body heat, but also, unlike other products, it allows your skin to ventilate and remain comfortably dry. Thermoskin® supports with Trioxon® lining are completely washable and “breathable” to help alleviate excessive perspiration, skin irritations and the unpleasant odor associated with neoprene products. Anatomically shaped supports are very comfortable to wear. <br><br> Thermoskin out performs other products because the unique Trioxon lining is designed to be soft against the skin. This minimizes skin irritation and perspiration while  helping to retain heat. With Thermoskin patients experience less pain and mastery of rehabilitation protocols is facilitated.

Metal splint positioned at 25 degrees helps prevent wrist movements that can cause Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. Fully adjustable velcro locking straps adjusts for a better fit.<br><br>  Thermoskin Thermal Supports contain the exclusive patented Trioxon lining that has been clinically proven to increase your surface and subcutaneous skin temperature 2 to 3° F. This helps increase the elasticity of muscles, tendons, and ligaments to reduce the risk of injury when under stress. Thermoskin Thermal Supports also increase the blood flow to damaged tissue to help speed up the healing process, while providing light compression to counteract tissue swelling. The spiral structure of the Trioxon lining creates a micro-climate which allows the skin to ventilate by wicking away moisture and does not close the pores of the skin. You can wear Thermoskin for extended periods of time without the discomfort you would have with other products.

It's specifically designed for personal cleaning and hygiene for anyone with limited mobility. <br><br> The Freedom Wand™ comes in three pieces, the handle, the extension and the head. Use the Freedom Wand™ with the handle and head for a total of 14 inches in length or add the extension for 21 inches. Because it's made from a polypropylene material, the freedom wand is very durable and easy to clean. <br><br> <b>The Head:</b> <br><br> The head is 9 inches long and has a slight curve to it to allow for proper reach. The head also has four ""fingers"" that extend out of the wand with the slide of a button. As they extend, they open to hold a shaver, sponge, ointment pad, tissue wad or other items. <br><br> When sliding the button back, the fingers go back into the wand, securing it in place and giving a tight grip, strength and a smooth end. To release an item, just push and slide the button back. It is that easy! The rinse hold in the head helps aid with cleaning in case any soil should get in the wand. <br><br> <b>The Extension:</b> <br><br> The extension is a 6½ inch piece. When combined with the head and the handle, the wand becomes 21 inches long. If a shorter wand is desired, the head and the handle can be put together without the extension for a length of 14 inches. Both the extension and the handle have quick and easy release buttons. <br><br> <b>The Handle:</b> <br><br> The handle is approximately 8 inches long. It is contoured for ease in holding and has a soft secure grip to eliminate slipping. It also has a loop on the end so that you can hang it in a convenient spot. <br><br> This is a non-returnable hygiene item.<!-- product-specs.html begins -->	<P><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2"">		<h4>Freedom Wand - multipurpose, portable, personal hygiene aid.

This award winning modular support system provides support and balance assistance to those who need extra help transitioning from a seated position to a standing position. The SuperPole has a high quality gripping surface that is particularly helpful for people with limited hand strength. It is constructed of heavy gauge steel for unfailing, rigid support. <br><br> SuperPole is a secure modular support structure that can be installed in minutes between a floor and ceiling and is held by a jack-screw expansion. The screw expands the pole to create enough tension between the floor and ceiling to hold the pole securely. Rubber pads on the ceiling plate and the floor plate hold the transfer pole in place and prevent marring of the ceiling or floor. Installs easily with no structural reinforcements needed. Foam hand grip provides a comfortable gripping surface, particularly useful for those with limited hand strength. Installs anywhere there is a floor and ceiling, placing transfer support directly where it is needed. Use it beside a bed, bath, toilet or chair.  <br><br> Note: The SuperPole™ System should only be installed between floors and ceilings of solid construction or injury may result. The SuperPole System™ should not be installed on loose floor coverings, in rooms with radiant ceiling heating, in mobile homes, or in suspended or angled ceilings.

The Super Pole with Super Bar can easily be installed beside a bed, bath, toilet or chair. This transfer system is more compact than a walker in small restricted areas such as washrooms, and is ideal for pivot transfers in narrow areas such as between bed and wall, narrow hallways, etc. In a shower, the Super Pole with Super Bar provides complete support for stepping over the tub wall without reaching for wall grab bars. The SuperBar can pivot away from shower curtains, allowing them to fully close during a shower. For toilet transfers, the SuperBar permits pulling up to standing and can provide leaning support while managing clothing. <br><br> Please note: The SuperPole System should only be installed between floors and ceiling of solid construction or injury may result.

This is a toilet seat riser that you install only once and that blends in with the bathroom. It was created to solve the problems created by those old, clunky disabled toilet seats. <br><br> There have always been a range of handicapped and disabled toilet seats on the market. But until now, users of these toilet seat risers had to compromise their comfort and dignity. The old toilet seat risers were clunky, ugly and flimsy. They were unsanitary and hard to clean. And they were a pain to mount and remove after every use. In other words, there was plenty of room for improvement. <br><br> The Easy Toilet Riser requires little additional cleaning. But most importantly, the Toilet Riser™ won’t force you to change your bathroom experience. <br><br> There are no new tools to use. No extra parts. You’ll get to use the same toilet you’re familiar with. The Easy Toilet Riser™ just boosts it a little higher. <br><br> The Easy Toilet Riser™ comes in a kit with everything you need for easy installation. Although The Medway Corporation Easy Toilet Riser™ ships in an 11 lb. package, the toilet seat riser is made with sturdy and high quality PVC strong enough to support up to 500 lbs. <br><br> Non returnable if packaging is opened. <br> <p> <a href=""/assets/images/toilet-seat-riser-specs.pdf"" target=""_blank""><img src=""/assets/images/pdf.jpg"" alt=""Commode and Toilet Riser"" width=""69"" height=""77"" border=""0"" />Commode and Toilet Riser Product Instructions</a> </p><!-- product-specs.html begins -->	<P><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2"">		<h4>Commode and Toilet Riser Specifications:</h4>	</FONT>	</P>	<TABLE CELLSPACING=""2"" CELLPADDING=""2"" BORDER=""0"">		<TR VALIGN=""TOP"">		<TD><IMG WIDTH=""24"" SRC=""/assets/images/spacer.gif"" HEIGHT=""12"" BORDER=""0""></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2""><B>Dimensions:</B></FONT></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2"">21 ¼ inches long x 11 ½ inches  wide x 4 inches high.</FONT></TD>	</TR>		<TR VALIGN=""TOP"">		<TD><IMG WIDTH=""24"" SRC=""/assets/images/spacer.gif"" HEIGHT=""12"" BORDER=""0""></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2""><B>Elevation:</B></FONT></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2"">4 inches.</FONT></TD>	</TR>		<TR VALIGN=""TOP"">		<TD><IMG WIDTH=""24"" SRC=""/assets/images/spacer.gif"" HEIGHT=""12"" BORDER=""0""></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2""><B>Color:</B></FONT></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2"">white.</FONT></TD>	</TR>		<TR VALIGN=""TOP"">		<TD><IMG WIDTH=""24"" SRC=""/assets/images/spacer.gif"" HEIGHT=""12"" BORDER=""0""></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2""><B>Includes:</B></FONT></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2"">Toilet Seat Riser, two (2) 6 inch long closet bolts, two (2) wax rings, one (1) extended water pipe, two (2) washers, two (2) nuts, installation manual.</FONT></TD>	</TR>		</TABLE>	<P><!-- product-specs.html ends -->","commode riser, raises commode, toilet riser, raises toilet, raise toilet, raise commode, for people with, arthritis, rheumatoid, osteoarthritis, elderly, seniors, handicap, disability, therapy, arthritis utensils, tools, devices, aids, arthritic","0","/assets/images/res_tolietriser.jpg","/assets/images/res_tolietriser.jpg","/assets/images/com_tolietriser.jpg","","","","ATS900","","0","","","","","Commode and Toilet Riser","<META name=""keywords"" CONTENT=""commode riser, raises commode, toilet riser, raises toilet, raise toilet, raise commode, for people with, arthritis, rheumatoid, osteoarthritis, elderly, seniors, handicap, disability, therapy, arthritis utensils, tools, devices, aids, arthritic""><META name=""description"" CONTENT=""The Easy Commode and Toilet Riser is an easy to use handicapped toilet riser that raises the commode without any of the hassles that those old raised toilet seats created.

For maximum support and safety for both the patient and the helper, we recommend that either a transfer belt or sling be used in conjunction with the Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc. <br><br> An individual with impaired mobility from paralysis or limited upper body functions can use the Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc unassisted in a very efficient way.  If the patient cannot use his/her upper extremities a helper will be needed. <br><br> The <b>Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc</b> is placed on the floor with the label facing downwards. The patient's feet are to be positioned completely on the disc to facilitate a smooth transfer and reduce back strain on both patient and helper.  The handle of the Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc should be placed facing the patient, to prevent interfering with the feet of the helper.  The helper should place one of his/her feet on the disc to safely monitor and control the transfer.  After using the Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc, it should immediately be removed from the floor to avoid accidents. <br><br> Because of the lightweight and convenient grip handle, the Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc is easy to use and carry.  The Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc is made of three high quality polymer plates, one turning on top of the other. The Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc is also equipped with anti-glide tapes on both sides to prevent slipping on the floor or when a patient is standing on the disc. <br><br> Transfer between a chair and a wheelchair:  The disc is ""locked"" in place when the helper places his/her heel comfortably on the floor and the rest of his/her foot firmly on the plate between the feet of the patient.  The patient wears a transfer belt and the helper holds on to the handles while guiding the patient through the transfer. <br><br> Transfer between a wheelchair and a toilet:  Proper use of the disc in this situation is identical to above, except it is safer and easier with two helpers.  The helper(s) can use their other, free hand(s) to help undress the patient before placing him/her on the toilet. <br><br> Transfer between a wheelchair and a bed:  Before you move a patient from a bed to a wheelchair, you should make sure that the wheelchair is positioned as close to the bed as possible, with the wheels locked.

Fits over 170 million vehicles in North America. <br><br> The <b>HandyBar</b> locks securely, and reliably, into position to help you get in to and out of a car. In addition, it is easy to insert and remove, it is strong, durable and affordable. The material is forged steel with corrosion resistant plating. At just 0.7 lb., and measuring approx. 9 in. long, the Handybar™ is sufficiently lightweight, and compact, for it to be carried around in a handbag or pack. The precisely shaped nose locks the Handybar™ securely into position with little effort and enables it to be removed just as easily. It is also cranked, or bent, over its length to enable it to be reversed to give just the right height and angle of grip for getting in and out of a vehicle. Smaller, more compact cars tend to be lower down, closer to the ground making it even more difficult to get in and out of them. Fortunately, the U-type striker plate is one of the most rugged components in a vehicle being designed to keep the door closed in the event of a side-impact crash. There is a striker on each of the door pillars enabling the Handybar™ to be used by both the driver and passengers. <br><br> Stainless steel bar with non-slip hand grip fits in space where car door latches. Provides secure assist in getting in and out of a car. Easy to store and carry. Includes seat belt cutter and side window breaker.

The unique design of these replacement walker footpads includes an O-ring to securely attach the Walker Coasters without tools. Unlike walker balls and tennis balls, Walker Coasters don’t absorb water or collect debris.<!-- product-specs.html begins -->	<P><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2"">		<h4>Easy to Use Walker Coasters Specifications:</h4>	</FONT>	</P>	<TABLE CELLSPACING=""2"" CELLPADDING=""2"" BORDER=""0"">		<TR VALIGN=""TOP"">		<TD><IMG WIDTH=""24"" SRC=""/assets/images/spacer.gif"" HEIGHT=""12"" BORDER=""0""></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2""><B>Fits:</B></FONT></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2"">all standard 1 inch walker legs.</FONT></TD>	</TR>		<TR VALIGN=""TOP"">		<TD><IMG WIDTH=""24"" SRC=""/assets/images/spacer.gif"" HEIGHT=""12"" BORDER=""0""></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2""><B>Width:</B></FONT></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2"">2 ½ inch diameter.</FONT></TD>	</TR>		<TR VALIGN=""TOP"">		<TD><IMG WIDTH=""24"" SRC=""/assets/images/spacer.gif"" HEIGHT=""12"" BORDER=""0""></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2""><B>Height:</B></FONT></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2"">1 ½ inches.</FONT></TD>	</TR>		<TR VALIGN=""TOP"">		<TD><IMG WIDTH=""24"" SRC=""/assets/images/spacer.gif"" HEIGHT=""12"" BORDER=""0""></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2""><B>Made:</B></FONT></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2"">USA.</FONT></TD>	</TR>		<TR VALIGN=""TOP"">		<TD><IMG WIDTH=""24"" SRC=""/assets/images/spacer.gif"" HEIGHT=""12"" BORDER=""0""></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2""><B>Color:</B></FONT></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2"">bright yellow.</FONT></TD>	</TR>		<TR VALIGN=""TOP"">		<TD><IMG WIDTH=""24"" SRC=""/assets/images/spacer.gif"" HEIGHT=""12"" BORDER=""0""></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2""><B>Material:</B></FONT></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2"">smooth, durable plastic.</FONT></TD>	</TR>		<TR VALIGN=""TOP"">		<TD><IMG WIDTH=""24"" SRC=""/assets/images/spacer.gif"" HEIGHT=""12"" BORDER=""0""></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2""><B>Includes:</B></FONT></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2"">package of 2.</FONT></TD>	</TR>		</TABLE>	<P><!-- product-specs.html ends -->","walker coasters, easy to use walker coasters, walker glides, walker aids, walker glide, universal walker glides, glides for walkers, walker glide cap, for people with, rheumatoid, osteoarthritis, elderly, seniors, handicap, disability, arthritis, arthritic, therapy, utensils, tools, devices, aids, products","0","/assets/images/walkercoaster.jpg","/assets/images/walkercoaster.jpg","/assets/images/walkercoaster-5.jpg","/assets/images/walkercoaster-4.jpg","","","ASN317,CBC400L","","0","","","","","Easy to Use Walker Coasters","<META name=""keywords"" CONTENT=""walker coasters, easy to use walker coasters, walker glides, walker aids, walker glide, universal walker glides, glides for walkers, walker glide cap, for people with, rheumatoid, osteoarthritis, elderly, seniors, handicap, disability, arthritis, arthritic, therapy, utensils, tools, devices, aids, products""><META name=""description"" CONTENT=""Easy to Use Walker Coasters make it easy for you to slide and glide your walker across most surfaces.

The light turns itself on when in motion and when it senses a low level light environment. The ""intelligent” light turns itself off after 30 seconds if there is no motion or when it senses a well-lit environment. The patented, hands-free, automatic illumination is the only personal visual aid that knows when to turn itself on and off.  <br><br> Simply flip the on/off switch to the on position, clip the light to round tubing of a cane, walker or rollator and start moving. Three bright LED lights are powered by two AAA batteries (included). The light uses two sensors. First, a motion sensor determines movement. After 30 seconds of not being moved, the light turns off.

The special shape of the gel allows air-flow to keep you cool and comfortable. Gel provides cushioning and protection from pressure. The gel distributes point pressure over a wide area thereby reducing the pressure per square inch, making you more comfortable. <br><br> Synergel is a proprietary silicone polymer that was designed to mimic the same physical characteristics as human fat tissue. This medical grade silicone gel will not dry out, rot,  flow or leak if cut or punctured. Dimensions gel provides protection from shearing and friction, is specifically designed to reduce pressure, impact, and vibration and remains pliable and soft when used in extreme temperatures. Because the gel does not absorb fluids, it is ideal for use in places where the pad might get wet.

When you stand from the typical recliner, it tilts forward, dropping the arms and seat of an already low chair by 3 - 4 inches.

When Recliner Risers are installed, they raise a chair 1 ¾ inches and limit the forward tilt allowing an additional 3 - 4 inches of lift.

The wraps will remain cold for 20 to 40 minutes.  <br><br> Hot: Moist heat quickly penetrates muscles and joints when a warm wrap is applied. The wrap will continue to provide moist heat for 20 to 30 minutes before it will need to be reheated. Heat helps to restore flexibility and provides excellent therapy for minor injuries during, and after rehabilitation exercises. <!-- product-specs.html begins -->	<P><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2"">		<h4>Elasto-Gel Therapy Mitten :: Hot or Cold Arthritis Therapy Specifications:</h4>	</FONT>	</P>	<TABLE CELLSPACING=""2"" CELLPADDING=""2"" BORDER=""0"">		<TR VALIGN=""TOP"">		<TD><IMG WIDTH=""24"" SRC=""/assets/images/spacer.gif"" HEIGHT=""12"" BORDER=""0""></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2""><B>Dimensions:</B></FONT></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2"">3 in.

Each bulb lasts 10X longer, too (10,000 hours). Unlike cheap imitations, your Verilux® EasyFlex Full Spectrum Floor Lamp comes with a 3-year limited warranty and our famous 30-day Risk-Free Guarantee. Oh, and there’s one more thing you’ll receive with your lamp that others don’t include – a matching utility tray. The tray attaches to your lamp without tools and has a non-skid pad for small items and slots for reading glasses, pens or other items.<!-- product-specs.html begins -->	<P><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2"">		<h4>Verilux EasyFlex Full Spectrum Floor Lamp Specifications:</h4>	</FONT>	</P>	<TABLE CELLSPACING=""2"" CELLPADDING=""2"" BORDER=""0"">		<TR VALIGN=""TOP"">		<TD><IMG WIDTH=""24"" SRC=""/assets/images/spacer.gif"" HEIGHT=""12"" BORDER=""0""></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2""><B>Height adjustment:</B></FONT></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2"">38.5"" - 54"".</FONT></TD>	</TR>		<TR VALIGN=""TOP"">		<TD><IMG WIDTH=""24"" SRC=""/assets/images/spacer.gif"" HEIGHT=""12"" BORDER=""0""></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2""><B>Base measures:</B></FONT></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2"">10.5”L x 9”W.</FONT></TD>	</TR>		<TR VALIGN=""TOP"">		<TD><IMG WIDTH=""24"" SRC=""/assets/images/spacer.gif"" HEIGHT=""12"" BORDER=""0""></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2""><B>Head measures:</B></FONT></TD>		<TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2"">10.375"" x 8.75"".</FONT></TD>	</TR>		</TABLE>	<P><!-- product-specs.html ends -->","verilux easyflex full spectrum floor lamp, easyflex full spectrum floor lamp, floor lamp, full spectrum floor lamp, verilux floor lamp, for people with, rheumatoid, osteoarthritis, elderly, seniors, handicap, disability, arthritis, arthritic, therapy, utensils, tools, devices, aids, products","0","/assets/images/easyflex-graphite.jpg","/assets/images/easyflex-graphite.jpg","/assets/images/easyflex-ivory.jpg","","","","AMI3017,ARB30","","0","","","","","Verilux EasyFlex Full Spectrum Floor Lamp","<META name=""keywords"" CONTENT=""verilux easyflex full spectrum floor lamp, easyflex full spectrum floor lamp, floor lamp, full spectrum floor lamp, verilux floor lamp, for people with, rheumatoid, osteoarthritis, elderly, seniors, handicap, disability, arthritis, arthritic, therapy, utensils, tools, devices, aids, products"">","","","0","0","","0","","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","2/13/2012","","","","","","","","","","","0","","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","-1","0","0","-1","","","0","","0","0","","","","0","0","0","0","0","0","verilux-easyflex-full-spectrum-floor-lamp.html","0"

Think of it as a stand-up trowel and multi-purpose gardening tool. No more burned out drills or bent and broken trowels. People of all ages, and those with disabilities find this landscaping tool easy to use. <br><br> The Planting Stick digs a round hole at the right depth and width which forms the perfect hole for planting. This gardening tool is designed to punch holes in difficult soils, such as wet soils, clay soils, ground covered by a thin layer of gravel or landscape fabric. <br><br> The Planting Stick’s shaft and auger are made of steel. At the crook, a foam handle cushions the turning crank. A plastic bearing inserted inside the foam handle keeps it from slipping down the shaft while turning. Topping it off is an easy to grip neoprene ball mounted on stainless steel ball-bearings. This adapted gardening tool is assembled using welded-steel construction, therefore there is nothing that can bend or break, and it is durable enough to last for many growing seasons. By turning the foam handle clockwise while pressing down on the ball, the auger will corkscrew into the ground to dig a planting hole. <br><br> The Planting Stick also handles other garden chores such as weeding, turning the compost bin and starting holes for posts with ease. <br> <!-- product-specs.html begins --> <P><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2""> <h4>The Planting Stick:</h4></FONT></P> <TABLE CELLSPACING=""2"" CELLPADDING=""2"" BORDER=""0""><TR VALIGN=""TOP""><TD><IMG WIDTH=""24"" SRC=""/assets/images/spacer.gif"" HEIGHT=""12"" BORDER=""0""></TD> <TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2""><B>Length:</B></FONT></TD> <TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2"">45 inches long.</FONT></TD></TR> <TR VALIGN=""TOP""><TD><IMG WIDTH=""24"" SRC=""/assets/images/spacer.gif"" HEIGHT=""12"" BORDER=""0""></TD> <TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2""><B>Weight:</B></FONT></TD> <TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2"">8 pounds.</FONT></TD></TR> <TR VALIGN=""TOP""><TD><IMG WIDTH=""24"" SRC=""/assets/images/spacer.gif"" HEIGHT=""12"" BORDER=""0""></TD> <TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2""><B>Color:</B></FONT></TD> <TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2"">Red.</FONT></TD></TR> <TR VALIGN=""TOP""><TD><IMG WIDTH=""24"" SRC=""/assets/images/spacer.gif"" HEIGHT=""12"" BORDER=""0""></TD> <TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2""><B>Materials:</B></FONT></TD> <TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2"">Steel, foam rubber, neoprene.</FONT></TD></TR> <TR VALIGN=""TOP""><TD><IMG WIDTH=""24"" SRC=""/assets/images/spacer.gif"" HEIGHT=""12"" BORDER=""0""></TD> <TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2""><B>Made In:</B></FONT></TD> <TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2"">USA.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE> <!-- product-specs.html ends -->","","0","assets/images/planting-stick_thumbnail.jpg","assets/images/planting-stick.png","assets/images/ags300-planting-stick-2.jpg","","","","","","0","The Planting Stick","The Planting Stick","","","The Planting Stick :: punch holes in a variety of soils","<META NAME=""DESCRIPTION"" CONTENT=""The Planting Stick helps prepare the perfect planting hole.
