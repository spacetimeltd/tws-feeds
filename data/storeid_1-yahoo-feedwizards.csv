Simply by tipping the Provale cup in a normal drinking motion, 5 or 10 cc of liquid is delivered. By returning the cup to its upright position, the chamber is refilled and ready to deliver another 5 or 10 cc. The Provale cup encourages normal drinking habits and small swallows. May help eliminate the need for pre-thickened liquids with some patients with dysphagia. Nose clearance minimizes head tilt. Easy to disassemble for cleaning. The Provale cup is dishwasher safe. Patented anti-suck mechanism prevents over-delivery of fluids. Transparent Outer Cup model allows liquid activity monitoring. Use with or without provided handles. Dishwasher safe.The advantages The PROVALE® Drinking Cup are: *Delivers a fixed delivery amount of liquid with every normal drinking motion. The New PROVALE® Cup's ease of use may allow for more patient independence. Because individual patient needs vary, a trained healthcare professional must make the decision on patient independence. *Patented mechanism prevents over-delivery of fluid. Unlike a ""sippy"" cup, The New PROVALE Cup has a patented feature that prevents over-delivery of fluid when the cup is used properly. Sucking on the drinking spout will not result in additional fluid being dispensed.*Good nose clearance to minimize head tilt. The Cup-In-A-Cup design of The PROVALE Cup provides very good nose clearance which allows patients to keep their chin in a proper position to make a good swallow. The inner or middle cup contains an angled channel that also allows the user to keep their chin in a good position for a proper swallow.*Can be used with water, nutritional supplements, and some thickened liquid products. *Optional one or two easy-grip-handle or no-handle design. *Travel-mug appearance is functional, yet inconspicuous. The PROVALE® Cup is designed with patient integrity in mind. *Designed to utilize normal drinking motion.*Easy and logical to assemble.*Easy-to-clean and institutional dishwasher-safe. No valves or tubes to clean. *Broad base to minimize tipping and spilling.","provale, provale cup, the provale cup, metered drinking cup, cup for dysphagia, swallowing disorders, swallowing problems, for the disabled, handicapped, elderly, seniors, physically impaired",instock,942,,,,,,1,"The Wright Stuff, Inc.",,In the Kitchen,"Cups, Glasses and Straws",Encourages normal drinking habits and small swallows.New cup for people with swallowing difficulties.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nearly 10% of the public suffers from this form of depression when deprived of precious sunshine. Now, the original Verilux HappyLight can be yours ? delivering a full 10,000 LUX of indoor light therapy without any harmful UV rays. And it can be hung on a wall or set on a table or counter for your morning sunshine bath.Research Findings:Follow-up Study shows 94% of patients stopped using anti-depressant drugs. While correct diagnosis of SAD has become more commonplace, treatment is the area where doctors and SAD sufferers need more education. In the past, doctors have been quick to prescribe an anti-depressant (like Prozac, Paxil or Zoloft) when a patient mentioned being ?depressed?. While drugs can sometimes be effective treating depression, they also have a well documented history of very serious side-effects. Light therapy is the natural, side-effect free alternative to anti-depressant pills.To illustrate, a 1997 research study titled ?Follow-up study of seasonal affective disorder in Switzerland?, conducted at the Psychiatric University Clinic, Basel, Switzerland, concluded that:?Over a number of years, the clinical diagnosis changed for the better in 64% of the patients? and that light therapy (and perhaps also light-oriented behaviour) reduced the incidence and depth of subsequent depressive episodes. Further evidence for this was the large reduction in use of conventional antidepressant drugs (from 17 to 1) during the follow-up period. Diagnosis of SAD was stable and reliable.?

Composed of a durable, specially weighted rubber compound, great care was taken to control the right amount of flexibility, giving the base its remarkable performance. Stairs are now easily managed. Quad canes need to be turned sideways on stairs, making the user uncomfortable and in some cases fearful. The AbleTripod® gives the user confidence to negotiate even the narrowest steps. The stress of impact on the user's hand is greatly reduced by the AbleTripod® Base , which flexes as you walk. The tips of the pods flex, grabbing while permitting the AbleTripod® to roll through, maintaining contact with the ground. The stability of the AbleTripod® base is not compromised whether on grass, gravel or sand , whereas typical canes may sink into the ground. The AbleTripod® Walking Cane Tip can be used in ways that no other cane can: its unique design enables the user to lean into the cane, experiencing both support and balance. The ability to lateralize gives the user a unique feeling of confidence, knowing that the AbleTripod® is less likely to slip out than quad canes. The patented AbleTripod® Base easily replaces your walking cane tip, addressing all of these issues and more.

Its innovative shape has a balanced handle that provides stability and comfort. This design enables you to more easily cut food by using a rocking motion on the gently curved outside tines.This knife and fork combo utensil is also recognized as a daily living aid for people with limited hand mobility-- from temporary injuries such as sprains to permanent conditions such as severe arthritis. It can be invaluable to individuals with no use of one hand due to conditions such as hemi-paralysis and amputations. The Knork® has been implemented in rehabilitation centers and hospitals around the country. Individuals who would otherwise require that their food be cut for them-- or else greatly limit their meal choices-- can gain greater independence and freedom by using this remarkable eating tool. Knork Features: The Head: The Knork's outer tines are curved and beveled, creating rounded cutting edges that are not serrated or even sharp to the touch. This utensil is as safe to the mouth as a standard fork. The curved shape enables the head to be rocked back and forth in a motion that is very much like that of a rocking chair. It is the combination of the beveled edge and the rocking motion that gives the Knork® its amazing cutting ability. The Finger Platform: The Knork® has an enlarged finger platform located between the handle and head. When trying to cut foods using a regular fork, the finger can develop a painful ""indentation"" from pressing down on the side of the narrow handle or tines. When using the Knork®, the finger rests on the smooth, comfortable platform. It also reduces the effort needed to rock the head back and forth, creating the cutting motion. As a result, the Knork® can cut through tougher foods such as pizza. Contoured Handle: An enlarged, rounded end gives the Knork® enhanced leverage, balance and stability. It is designed to be equally easy to use with either the right or left hand.

The systems may even allow the user to live at home while receiving outpatient care, rather than living in a long term facility and even for travelling! Tissue Friendly - Elimination of Skin Friction It's a well documented fact: lifting leads to injury. For example, patient movement tasks statistically place nursing personnel in the top percentile of the U.S. labor force for back injuries. At the same time, the person being lifted is at risk for arm and brachial plexus type injuries as well as back injuries from being torqued or twisted. The risk of such injuries is tremendously reduced when lifting is eliminated. The frictionless, lateral slide is clearly the state of the art in patient transfer. Versatility The design of the BeasyTrans™ Easy Transfer Systems make it possible to apply sliding technology to a wide range of transfer and therapeutic functions in both the clinical and homecare environment. For example, strategic placement of the Beasy seat under a draw sheet allows a minimum number of caregivers to easily perform such difficult transfers as bed to gurney, supine, or boosting of patients.Because the seat easily rotates 360 degrees, the systems can be used for range of motion exercises for hands, feet or other body parts.",,instock,942,,,,,,1,"The Wright Stuff, Inc.",111411,On The Move,"Transfer Discs, Slides and Boards",Longer length will accommodate patients and transfers in areas where space is not an issue.,,,,BeasyTrans Easy Transfer Board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It?s the CPAP Multi-Mask Sleep Aid .The American Sleep Apnea Association identifies CPAP therapy as the most common treatment for sleep apnea. CPAP therapy works by preventing the airway from closing during sleep. It is administered at bedtime through a nasal or facial mask held in place by velcro straps around the patient?s head. The mask is connected by a tube to a small air compressor. The CPAP machine sends air under pressure through the tube and into the mask, where it imparts positive pressure to the upper airways, preventing the tissues in the back of the throat from collapsing during sleep.This is an extremely effective form of treatment when used in compliance with doctors orders. However, non-compliance is a big issue. It has been estimated that over 65% of patients use the machine for a maximum of just 4 hours per night when it should be used for the duration of the patient?s sleep. Additionally, many patients report using the CPAP for just a few nights out of the week. Discomfort is a major factor contributing to non-compliance. During side sleeping or stomach sleeping, the mask presses and rubs against the patient?s face, which leads to discomfort and can also distort the mask, causing leaks and exacerbating the problem of non-compliance. CPAP Sleep Aid Pillow Features: Improves mask comfort. Freedom of movement during sleep. Multi-position sleeping for side, back and stomach sleepers. Neck support and spinal alignment. Reduces mask leaks. Mask pressure on face. Airway resistance due to better neck support. CPAP Sleep Aid Pillow Specifications: 20L X 13W x 4H.

May be used for independent transfers with professional approval. Many facilities use this system for boosting patients in bed. The ""No-Lift"" Frictionless BeasyTrans™ Easy Transfer System BeasyTrans™ Systems are totally portable. With the BeasyTrans™ Systems, most users can achieve regular access to an automobile. For some, this may mean a greater quality of life. The visiting of friends and relatives may be resumed. Educational and cultural undertakings can be attended. The systems may even allow the user to live at home while receiving outpatient care, rather than living in a long term facility and even for travelling! Tissue Friendly - Elimination of Skin Friction It's a well documented fact: lifting leads to injury. For example, patient movement tasks statistically place nursing personnel in the top percentile of the U.S. labor force for back injuries. At the same time, the person being lifted is at risk for arm and brachial plexus type injuries as well as back injuries from being torqued or twisted. The risk of such injuries is tremendously reduced when lifting is eliminated. The frictionless, lateral slide is clearly the state of the art in patient transfer. Versatility The design of the BeasyTrans™ Easy Transfer Systems make it possible to apply sliding technology to a wide range of transfer and therapeutic functions in both the clinical and homecare environment. For example, strategic placement of the Beasy seat under a draw sheet allows a minimum number of caregivers to easily perform such difficult transfers as bed to gurney, supine, or boosting of patients.Because the seat easily rotates 360 degrees, the systems can be used for range of motion exercises for hands, feet or other body parts.",,instock,942,,,,,,1,"The Wright Stuff, Inc.",111412,On The Move,"Transfer Discs, Slides and Boards","Perfect for smaller areas, like bathroom transfers.",,,,BeasyTrans Easy Transfer Board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Video for Alzheimer's Patients contains pictures of flowers along with music from the early 20th century brings back warm memories in a beautiful, relaxing format. In the fall of 2007, my mom asked if I would help keep track of her checking account. She expressed a fear of making a serious financial mistake because she had been forgetting to write entries in her ledger. My mother had never missed a payment, successfully balancing her checkbook to her 80th year. But there she was, asking me for help. This thoroughly independent lady painfully relinquished control of her finances. As time went on, she had to give up more and more control as she experienced a number of strokes and the onslaught of Alzheimer's. By the end of 2008, she could no longer live independently and moved into an assisted living facility. The doctors told her she had Alzheimer's/Dementia for a number of years, which was taking a toll on her health. She was in and out of hospitals five times in her last year. One of the hospitals provided a television channel with 24/7 videos and music. We watched for hours, and I quizzed her on the flowers and trees on the television. You see, I am a landscape designer with a background in horticulture. My mom got me interested in plants at a young age. She helped me get a job at a local nursery when I was 13 years old. One day in the hospital, I thought about using the thousands of flower photographs I have taken over the years to make a DVD video for persons with Alzheimer's and other dementia. The pictures of flowers along with music from the early 20th Century bring back warm memories in a beautiful, relaxing format. The video is 60 minutes long and has over 400 high-quality images of flowers. Some pictures include birds, bees or butterflies. The music consists of classics such as America The Beautiful, Shine On Harvest Moon, Just A Closer Walk, A Bicycle Built For Two, Amazing Grace, and God Be With You Till We Meet Again. My mother lost her battle with Alzheimer's in June of 2009, but her legacy lives on through the video by helping others appreciate the beauty of God's creation.

Using the ergonomic EzGrip® ResQ Gel Pen is a unique experience -- not only for its writing abilities ? described as ??floating on paper,? but having the distinction as a pen that cradles and conforms to your extended finger and tip. Only the slightest touch of that one first finger tip is needed to provide downward writing pressure. Like touching a computer key ? but lighter. The other fingers can just ""go along for the ride."" It?s not the usual everyday writing experience, but one more comfortable and advanced.The gel ink is closest to fountain pen ink or rollerball in it's writing characteristics. It flows smoothly, and dries quickly.By using the EzGrip ResQ Gel Pen, it?s possible to never again get writer?s cramp ? never again contemplate the onset of any ""Itis"" ? Tendonitis, Arthritis? or repetitive Stress Injuries (RSI?s) such as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. In practical terms it also means that even having those conditions will not matter. Their mechanisms or weaknesses will not enter into the writing process. The EzGrip pen is often called the ""miracle pen"" for persons with arthritis, tendonitis, other hand problems or cramping. It neutralizes hand difficulties immediately. Here?s How: Using the EzGrip ergonomic pen as described, the built-in mechanisms within our hands and arms that create those weaknesses are actually disconnected or bypassed.The patented EzGrip enables the individual to switch positions, relying on other fingers. Many of us write in personal ways ? with different finger holds. The EzGrip allows users to switch fingers at any time to adapt to their individual style of writing. More specifically, the side of the thumb can be used for downward writing pressure ? even the middle finger knuckle. There is no incorrect way to hold and use an EzGrip. It?s your choice. And it's a choice that can save you pain and discomfort. Uses Parker style refills. EzGrip ResQ Gel Pen Features: Clinically tested ergonomic design. EzGrip pen helps reduce writing fatigue. Requires up to 57% less pressure than standard pens. EzGrip ResQ Gel Pen Specifications: Pen color: silver w/ navy grip, soft rubber. Ink color: black.

Healthcare professionals are increasingly recognizing obesity as a risk factor for diabetes and associated complications, including heel pressure ulcers. Heelift® Bariatric Suspension Boot helps prevent heel pressure ulcers in patients who are particularly prone to suffer from the condition. Specifically, Heelift Bariatric was developed for patients weighing up to 600 pounds who have a calf circumference of between 12 to 23 inches. Like Heelift Standard, Heelift Bariatric offloads the heel by redistributing pressure from the heel to the patient's calf. The design of Heelift Bariatric minimizes contact between the patient's leg and objects that can cause pressure at the heel or at folds in the skin. Rounded, adjustable straps and a smooth, friction-free tricot backing also ensure that the Heelift will not rub against or cause impressions on the patient's other leg. Together with diligent care and monitoring, Heelift Bariatric can help even the most at-risk patients prevent heel pressure ulcers. Boot is non-returnable if packaging is opened. Heelift Bariatric Suspension Boot Features: Extended Stitching: Located along the top rim, the added stitching narrows the forefoot and increases support to provide improved protection against foot drop, equines deformity, or heel cord contracture. ""Easy-on, easy-off"" rounded straps and D-ring closures: Padded Velcro® straps are easy for the patient and/or healthcare professional to use and can easily be adjusted to accommodate specific patient needs. Friction-free tricot backing: Unlike other suspension products, which can have sharp edges on the back that can rub against the patient's other leg, Heelift is manufactured with a smooth tricot backing that aids in patient mobility and helps ensure patient safety. Smooth foam: Heelift Bariatric is available in Smooth foam only. Smooth foam is ideal for patients with edematous legs as it will not create ""impressions"" on the leg. Ventilation holes: Ventilation holes provide additional air circulation to promote increased patient comfort. Tricot covered stiffener: This feature prevents Heelift from buckling for added patient comfort and safety. The Heelift features forefoot support using a spring back technology to keep the foot upright. The Heelift can be autoclaved for sterilization. Close the straps and place in a normal autoclave wrapper. The Heelift can be machine-washed and dried. Simply tighten the straps and enclose in a net laundry bag or a pillow case.

Children, just like adults, are at risk for heel pressure ulcers if they are stationary for long periods of time due to health conditions or multihour surgery.

For people with muscle control issues, hand ailments, severe arthritis or similar conditions, successful self feeding can be a real challenge. All scooper plates have a slightly taller rim on one side that has a reverse curve. The curve helps in scooping food onto a utensil. As food is pushed into this curve, it naturally rolls back onto a spoon or fork. Higher edges around the rest of the plate help corral foods and reduce the opportunity for spills. Scoop dishes are suitable for both adults and children. However, they are typically smaller than regular dinner plates, which is ideal for better portion size control. The Blue Scooper Dish is made of a darker blue plastic and the dark blue background provides high contrast for light color foods which may not be easily identified on white plates by persons with declining vision (a frequent occurrence with Alzheimer's patients). The Blue Scooper Plate diameter is 6 ¾ inches and has a circular shape. The edges are curved and half inch high with a one inch high reverse curve for scooping food.

Secure tube while not in use by coiling onto pouch face and then close bottom flap securely over tube coil.

Topping it off is an easy to grip neoprene ball mounted on stainless steel ball-bearings. This adapted gardening tool is assembled using welded-steel construction, therefore there is nothing that can bend or break, and it is durable enough to last for many growing seasons. By turning the foam handle clockwise while pressing down on the ball, the auger will corkscrew into the ground to dig a planting hole. The Planting Stick also handles other garden chores such as weeding, turning the compost bin and starting holes for posts with ease. The Planting Stick Features: Instantly digs the perfect hole.
