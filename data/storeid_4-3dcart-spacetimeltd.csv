Composed of a durable, specially weighted rubber compound, great care was taken to control the right amount of flexibility, giving the base its remarkable performance.  <br><br> Stairs are now easily managed. Quad canes need to be turned sideways on stairs, making the user uncomfortable and in some cases fearful. The <b>AbleTripod®</b> gives the user confidence to negotiate even the narrowest steps. <br><br> The stress of impact on the user's hand is greatly reduced by the <b>AbleTripod® Base</b>, which flexes as you walk. The tips of the pods flex, grabbing while permitting the AbleTripod® to roll through, maintaining contact with the ground. The stability of the AbleTripod® base is not compromised whether on grass, gravel or sand , whereas typical canes may sink into the ground. <br><br> The <b>AbleTripod® Walking Cane Tip</b> can be used in ways that no other cane can: its unique design enables the user to lean into the cane, experiencing both support and balance. The ability to lateralize gives the user a unique feeling of confidence, knowing that the AbleTripod® is less likely to slip out than quad canes. <br><br> The patented <b>AbleTripod® Base</b> easily replaces your walking cane tip, addressing all of these issues and more. <br><br> The base comes in 4 standard-size openings: 5/8"", 3/4"", 7/8"", 1"" and 11/16"" <br><br> <b>**See Diagram above for proper fit.**</b> <!-- product-specs.html starts -->        <P STYLE=""margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 30px""><FONT FACE=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">                <h4>AbleTripod® Walking Cane Base Specifications:</h4>        </FONT>        </P>        <TABLE CELLSPACING=""2"" CELLPADDING=""2"" BORDER=""0"">                <TR VALIGN=""TOP"">                <TD><IMG WIDTH=""14"" src=""/assets/uploaded/spacer.gif"" HEIGHT=""12"" BORDER=""0""></TD>                <TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2""><B>4 standard-size openings:</B></FONT></TD>                <TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2"">5/8"", 3/4"", 7/8"", 1"" and 11/16""</FONT></TD>        </TR>                <TR VALIGN=""TOP"">                <TD><IMG WIDTH=""14"" src=""/assets/uploaded/spacer.gif"" HEIGHT=""12"" BORDER=""0""></TD>                <TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2""><B>Weight</B></FONT></TD>                <TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2"">8 1/2 ounces</FONT></TD>        </TR>                </TABLE>","AbleTripod®, AbleTripod base, walking cane tip, tip replacement for walking cane, able tripod, mobility aids, cane accessories, products, supplies, for the elderly, seniors, disabled, handicapped, physically impaired, cane base",instock,942,,,,,,4,"The Wright Stuff, Inc",,Canes & Cane Accessories,,"Makes your walking cane self-standing, provides maximum stability and function to your cane.",,,"ADM1366,ADLPL36",,,,,1~1~21.95,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the BeasyTrans™ Systems, most users can achieve regular access to an automobile. For some, this may mean a greater quality of life. The visiting of friends and relatives may be resumed. Educational and cultural undertakings can be attended. The systems may even allow the user to live at home while receiving outpatient care, rather than living in a long term facility and even for travelling! <br><br> It's a well documented fact: lifting leads to injury. For example, patient movement tasks statistically place nursing personnel in the top percentile of the U.S. labor force for back injuries. At the same time, the person being lifted is at risk for arm and brachial plexus type injuries as well as back injuries from being torqued or twisted. The risk of such injuries is tremendously reduced when lifting is eliminated. The frictionless, lateral slide is clearly the state of the art in patient transfer. <br><br> The design of the BeasyTrans™ Easy Transfer boards make it possible to apply sliding technology to a wide range of transfer and therapeutic functions in both the clinical and homecare environment.  <br><br> For example, strategic placement of the Beasy seat under a draw sheet allows a minimum number of caregivers to easily perform such difficult transfers as bed to gurney, supine, or boosting of patients. <br><br> Because the seat easily rotates 360 degrees, the systems can be used for range of motion exercises for hands, feet or other body parts.  <DIV ALIGN=""Center""><TABLE BORDER=""1"" CELLPADDING=""1"" CELLSPACING=""1"" style=""border: 1px solid #000000; margin-top: 1px;""><TR><th colspan=""4"">AVAILABLE BEASYTRANS™ MODELS</th> </TR><TR><th>Model</th><th>Description</th> <th>Dimensions</th><th>Weight</th></TR></TD><TR><TD><b>BeasyTrans™</b></TD><TD>Ideal for automobile transfers, for space-limited transfers and bed repositioning.</TD><TD>40""L x 12""W</TD><TD>6½lbs </TD></TR><br /> <TR><TD><b>BeasyGlyder™</b></TD><TD>Designed for situations when the wheelchair arm is not removable or there is an obstacle present.</TD> <TD>32""L x 10""W</TD><TD>4½lbs.</TD><br /> </TR><TR><TD><b>Beasy II™</b></TD> <TD>Ideal for smaller areas, such as transfers in the bathroom or for boosting in bed.</TD><TD>27½""L x 12""W</TD> <TD>4½lbs.</TD></TR></TABLE></DIV><br />  <h3>BeasyTrans™ Easy Transfer System Training Video</h3>  <a href=""http://site.wrightstuff.biz/images/BeasyTrans_training-video.wmv"" target=""_blank"">BeasyTrans Easy Transfer Board Training Video</a><!-- product-specs.html starts -->        <P STYLE=""margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 30px""><FONT FACE=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">                <h4>Beasy Transfer Boards Specifications:</h4>        </FONT>        </P>        <TABLE CELLSPACING=""2"" CELLPADDING=""2"" BORDER=""0"">                <TR VALIGN=""TOP"">                <TD><IMG WIDTH=""14"" src=""/assets/uploaded/spacer.gif"" HEIGHT=""12"" BORDER=""0""></TD>                <TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2""><B>Weight Capacity:</B></FONT></TD>                <TD><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" SIZE=""2"">400 lbs</FONT></TD>        </TR>                </TABLE>","Beasy Transfer Boards, beasy transfer board, beasy transfer slide, beasy transfer systems, mobility aids, wheelchair, walker gear, accessories, for the elderly, seniors, disabled, handicapped, physically impaired ",instock,942,,,,,,4,"The Wright Stuff, Inc",,"Sitting, Standing and Transfer Aids",,Gliding seat makes transfers easier.,,,"AST415,CPO65",,,,,1~1~199.95,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For maximum support and safety for both the patient and the helper, we recommend that either a transfer belt or sling be used in conjunction with the Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc. <br><br> An individual with impaired mobility from paralysis or limited upper body functions can use the Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc unassisted in a very efficient way. If the patient cannot use his/her upper extremities a helper will be needed. <br><br> The SafetySure Transfer Pivot Disc is placed on the floor with the label facing downwards. The patient's feet are to be positioned completely on the disc to facilitate a smooth transfer and reduce back strain on both patient and helper. The handle of the Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc should be placed facing the patient, to prevent interfering with the feet of the helper. The helper should place one of his/her feet on the disc to safely monitor and control the transfer. After using the Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc, it should immediately be removed from the floor to avoid accidents. <br><br> Because of the lightweight and convenient grip handle, the SafetySure Transfer Pivot Disc is easy to use and carry. The Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc is made of three high quality polymer plates, one turning on top of the other. The SafetySure Transfer Pivot Disc is also equipped with anti-glide tape on both sides to prevent slipping on the floor or when a patient is standing on the disc. <br><br> <b>Transfer between a chair and a wheelchair:</b> The disc is ""locked"" in place when the helper places his/her heel comfortably on the floor and the rest of his/her foot firmly on the plate between the feet of the patient. The patient wears a transfer belt and the helper holds on to the handles while guiding the patient through the transfer. <br><br> <b>Transfer between a wheelchair and a toilet:</b> Proper use of the disc in this situation is identical to above, except it is safer and easier with two helpers. The helper(s) can use their other, free hand(s) to help undress the patient before placing him/her on the toilet. <br><br> <b>Transfer between a wheelchair and a bed:</b> Before you move a patient from a bed to a wheelchair, you should make sure that the wheelchair is positioned as close to the bed as possible, with the wheels locked.

In addition, the Auto Handy Bar Transfer Aid is easy to insert and remove, it is strong, durable and affordable. The material is forged steel with corrosion resistant plating. At just 0.7 lb., and measuring approx. 9 in. long, the Handybar™ is sufficiently lightweight, and compact, for it to be carried around in a handbag or pack.  <br><br> The precisely shaped nose locks the Handybar™ securely into position with little effort and enables it to be removed just as easily.

Simply raising the chair by 5 or 6 inches, necessary for independent standing, makes it dangerously unstable. Stander has developed a safe and easy solution! <br><br> When Recliner Risers are installed, they raise a chair 1 ¾ inches and limit the forward tilt allowing an additional 3 - 4 inches of lift.

This award winning modular support system is ideal for people with balance issues and for people needing mobility support. This grab bar provides support and balance assistance to those who need extra help transitioning from a seated position to a standing position. <br><br>  SuperPole is a secure structure that is easy to install and easy to relocate - no drilling, no screws. It can be installed in minutes between a floor and ceiling and is held by a jackscrew expansion. The screw expands the pole to create enough tension between the floor and ceiling to hold the pole securely. Rubber pads on the ceiling plate and the floor plate hold the transfer pole in place and prevent marring of the ceiling or floor. Installs easily with no structural reinforcements needed. Foam hand grip provides a comfortable gripping surface, particularly useful for those with limited hand strength. Installs anywhere there is a floor and ceiling, placing transfer support directly where it is needed. Use it beside a bed, bath, toilet or chair. <br><br> Note: The SuperPole™ System should only be installed between floors and ceilings of solid construction or injury may result. The SuperPole System™ should not be installed on loose floor coverings, in rooms with radiant ceiling heating, in mobile homes, or in suspended or angled ceilings.
